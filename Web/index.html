            <h1 class = "block">The Arrest Of Katia Solaz-Nitikin</h1>
            <p style= "background-color: pink; color: indigo;">Katia Solaz-Nitikin, a Cuban exile, locked away in the Los Santee Women's Maximum Security Prison.
                She is being charged with first degree larceny and two cases of gruesome manslaughter of former 
                CIA operative and her host, Emerson Pike, and maid at the Pike Reidence, Olivia Romero Silva.</p>
                
            <h1 style = "text-align: center; font-size: large;"> Assasination of Lee Harvey Oswald</h1>
            <p style= "background-color: pink; color: indigo; font-size: medium;"> On 24 November 1963, Dallas, Texas, police were transferring Lee Harvey Oswald (1939-1963), who had
                been arrested for murdering President John F. Kennedy (1917-1963) two days earlier, from one jail 
                to another. In the jail's basement garage, a crowd of journalists, photographers, and police watched 
                as Oswald emerged and was about to be placed in a police car. In an action caught on television cameras, 
                Jack Ruby (1912-1967), an owner of a Dallas nightclub and admirer of President Kennedy, edged forward in 
                the crowd, drew a gun, and killed Oswald. Convicted of murder, Ruby was sentenced to be executed. He 
                appealed and won a retrial on the basis that procedural errors had occurred. Before the retrial could be 
                held, however, Ruby died in prison in 1967 of natural causes.</p>
            
            <h1 style= "text-align: center; font-size: large;"> Haitian Dictator, Papa Doc</h1>
            <p style= "background-color: green; color: honeydew; font-size: medium;">Although patently a dictator who would not hesitate to kill his enemies in order to main tain his power over
                the black Republic of Haiti, Francois Duvalier would have had the world believe he was really just a simple 
                little country doctor, so loved by his people that it became his abiding duty to remain “President for Life.”
                Huge likenesses of Papa Doc, as he enjoyed being called, were plastered on walls in his capital city, Port‐au 
                Prince, and from time to time he ordered “spontaneous” demonstrations of affection, in which thousands of his 
                largely illiterate and desperately poor subjects were trucked into the capital to scream frenziedly “Du‐val‐yeah, 
                Du‐val‐yeah!” and “Viva Papa Doc!” And to further assure his as sumed benignity, Duvalier had his rubber‐stamp 
                legislature pro claim him Incorruptible Leader of the Great Majority of the Haitian People, Renovator of the Republic, 
                Chief of the Revo lution and Spiritual Father of the Nation.&#128520;&#128520;&#128520;</p>
