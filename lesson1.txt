Hello.
This is Interceptor SBX-1.
Fort Greely is down.
As of now SBX-1 is the only interceptor that stands between us and Armageddon.    
The Rogue Russians are in possession of 16 IBCM missiles stolen from Tavlinka.    
They are aimed at 16 states. And in the next one hour, America will no longer exist.
The rest of the world will watch as today America dies in a paraxysm of fear.     
State number one Los Angeles, the people of the City Of Angels...                
Hope you are prepared
